# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) study repository! This repository is created as part of my academic journey in understanding and mastering the concepts of various data structures and algorithms. The primary focus here is on learning and implementing these concepts through Python, given its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to serve as a personal learning space where I document my progress, challenges, and solutions as I navigate through the DSA course this semester. It is intended to:

- Provide a structured environment for practicing coding solutions related to DSA.
- Serve as a reference point for revisiting concepts and code implementations.
- Showcase the learning curve and improvements over time.
- Encourage the exploration of implementing DSA concepts in languages other than Python, to broaden programming skills and understanding.

## Course Coverage

The course and, by extension, this repository will cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Basic to advanced data structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.).
- Algorithm analysis and Time Complexity calculation.
- Sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
- Graph algorithms and traversals (DFS, BFS, MST, Shortest Paths, etc.).
- Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer strategies.

## Problem-Solving Platforms

In addition to the coursework, this repository will also feature problem solutions and insights from various coding platforms such as:

- **LeetCode**: Tackling a variety of algorithmic challenges and participating in contests to test my problem-solving skills.
- **HackerRank**: Engaging in domain-specific exercises ranging from data structures to mathematics, enhancing my coding proficiency.

These platforms offer a diverse range of problems that help in applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, thereby enriching the learning experience.

## Implementation Language

While the primary language for code examples and solutions will be **Python**, the repository may occasionally include implementations in other programming languages (e.g., Java, JavaScript) for comparative learning and understanding the complexities of each language in the context of DSA.


## Pesronal Notes on Notion

As part of my comprehensive approach to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms, I maintain a detailed collection of personal notes. These notes are an extension of the learning and exploration that takes place within this repository. They include additional insights, explanations, and reflections on the concepts and problems I encounter throughout my DSA journey.
